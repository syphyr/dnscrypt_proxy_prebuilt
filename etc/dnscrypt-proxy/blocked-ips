## Response containing blacklisted IP addresses will be blocked

## Sample feeds of suspect IP addresses:
## - https://github.com/stamparm/ipsum
## - https://github.com/tg12/bad_packets_blocklist
## - https://block.energized.pro/extensions/ips/formats/list.txt
## Use only one of the levels from that list. 1 is not very reliable
## (may have a lot of false positives), 8 is the most reliable subset.
